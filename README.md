## Authors: Chi-Hsin Lo, Subrato Chakravorty, Utkrisht Rajkumar

### Description
This is **project D: Severstal Steel Defect Detection** using semantic segmentation by team **3Nature_2Journal_8GPU**. 

The dataset for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection/data). To run with our default path setup, create a new folder called "inputs" in the same directory as the one containing this cloned respository. Download and extract the dataset inside "inputs." The kaggle submission kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/urajkumar/ece285-project-d). It contains the code to upload submission.csv files and submit to kaggle.

### Requirements
All the package requirements can be found in requirements.txt. To install the requirements:

```
git clone https://github.com/ucrajkumar/ece285
cd ece285
pip install -r requirements.txt
